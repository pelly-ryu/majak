**Review**: Core infrastructure complete. Ready to test and then enhance with decision capture.

### Step 3: Decision Capture Implementation (Completed Clean)
**Date**: 2025-08-03  
**Action**: Enhanced discard() function with detailed reasoning capture

**Files Modified**:
- `src/ai_offense.js` - Modified `discard()` function to capture reasoning in review mode
- `src/review_engine.js` - Added `captureDiscardReasoning()` and `explainTileChoice()` functions
- `test/test_review.html` - Enhanced test to verify reasoning capture

**Components Added**:
- `captureDiscardReasoning()` - Captures complete tile priority analysis
- `explainTileChoice()` - Generates human-readable explanations
- Enhanced `discard()` function with conditional reasoning capture
- Reasoning data structure includes: tile priorities, decision factors, alternatives, strategy context

**Key Features Implemented**:
- Non-intrusive design: Only captures data when `isReviewMode()` is true
- Complete tile analysis preservation (priority, efficiency, yaku, dora, waits, danger, safety)
- Alternative options tracking (top 5 choices with reasoning)
- Detailed explanation generation with specific scoring breakdown
- Support for different decision types (normal_discard, fold, riichi)

**Status**: ✅ **Completed Clean**
- All core decision capture functionality implemented
- Review mode integration working without affecting normal operation
- Detailed explanations generated from captured data
- Test framework updated to verify functionality

**Review**: Decision capture implementation complete and tested. Ready to extend to call decisions.

### Step 4: Call Decision Capture Implementation (Completed Clean)
**Date**: 2025-08-03  
**Action**: Enhanced callTriple() function with detailed call reasoning capture

**Files Modified**:
- `src/ai_offense.js` - Modified `callTriple()` function to capture call reasoning at decision points
- `src/review_engine.js` - Added `captureCallReasoning()` and `explainCallDecision()` functions

**Components Added**:
- `captureCallReasoning()` - Captures call analysis including combinations, hand evaluation, and constraints
- `explainCallDecision()` - Generates explanations for call accept/decline decisions
- Enhanced `callTriple()` function with reasoning capture at all major decision points

**Key Features Implemented**:
- Comprehensive call analysis capture (available tile, combinations, hand values, strategy context)
- Decision point tracking with specific reasons (strategy_no_calls, end_game_tenpai, general_acceptance, etc.)
- Combination evaluation with dora values and tile analysis
- Context capture (shanten, scores, yaku potential, tiles left, hand state)
- Detailed explanations for call decisions with reasoning breakdown

**Decision Points Captured**:
1. Strategy restrictions (no calls allowed)
2. End-game tenpai calls  
3. Yaku insufficient calls
4. Safety/folding considerations
5. Shanten improvement analysis
6. Value-based call acceptance

**Status**: ✅ **Completed Clean**
- All major call decision points instrumented with reasoning capture
- Non-intrusive design maintains normal operation when review mode is off
- Comprehensive explanation generation for call decisions
- Integration with existing decision capture framework

**Review**: Call decision capture implementation complete. Ready to move to Phase 2 comparison framework.

### Step 5: Enhanced Comparison Framework (Completed Clean)
**Date**: 2025-08-03  
**Action**: Implemented comprehensive decision comparison and teaching framework

**Files Modified**:
- `src/review_engine.js` - Enhanced `compareDecisions()` with detailed analysis
- `test/test_review.html` - Updated test to verify comparison functionality

**Files Created**:
- `test/review_demo.html` - Comprehensive demo showcasing all review system features

**Components Added**:
- Enhanced `compareDecisions()` with ranking, quality assessment, and detailed factor comparison
- `generateDetailedComparison()` - Provides side-by-side analysis of player vs AI choices
- `generateTeachingExplanation()` - Creates skill-level appropriate explanations
- `getKeyLessonForMove()` - Generates focused learning points

**Key Features Implemented**:
- **Move Quality Assessment**: Optimal/Good/Acceptable/Suboptimal classification
- **Ranking System**: Shows where player's choice ranks among AI's evaluated options
- **Factor Breakdown**: Detailed comparison of efficiency, safety, yaku, dora, shanten
- **Teaching Adaptation**: Different explanation styles for beginner vs advanced players
- **Key Differences Identification**: Highlights the most important decision factors
- **Priority Scoring**: Quantifies how much better/worse player's choice was

**Quality Levels**:
- **Optimal**: Player choice matches AI recommendation
- **Good**: Player choice ranks in top 2 alternatives  
- **Acceptable**: Player choice ranks 3-5 among alternatives
- **Suboptimal**: Player choice ranks lower than 5th or not evaluated

**Status**: ✅ **Completed Clean**
- Complete comparison framework implemented and tested
- Teaching explanations working for different skill levels
- Detailed factor analysis providing actionable feedback
- Demo system showcasing all features in realistic scenarios
- Framework ready for integration with game record parsing

**Review**: Comparison framework implementation complete. Core review system now fully functional for educational use.

## System Overview
The review system is now fully functional with the following capabilities:

### Core Components
1. **Game State Management** - Can load and analyze any mahjong position
